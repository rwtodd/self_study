# Bird and Wadler

This is a place to do exercises in _Introduction to Functional Programming_,
1st edition.  The book uses a quasi-_Miranda_ as its language; I'll be
using _Haskell_.

I realize there is a second edition of the book that uses _haskell_, but
I'm sticking with the first edition for a few reasons:

  + I already own it
  + translating the examples to haskell will help me learn haskell
  + Some people out on the internet think the first edition was superior

As always, I don't know if I'll work _every_ exercise, but any that I
do will be recorded here.
