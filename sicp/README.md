# SICP

SICP, the _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_, is
a classic computer science text.  I thought I'd run through 
the exercises in scala.  Knowing me, I will throw in some
answers in alternate languages as well!

I'm not sure... I think there is a meta-circular interpreter 
section at some point, so I will probably create a tiny scheme 
interpreter in scala at that point, and hopefully will be able to 
do the exercises against that.  If not, I will drop down to scheme 
for those.
