So, here's some text. I hope this works. I really think that
troff has a lot going for it relative to TeX, in that the
whole system is a lot simpler. It's too bad that Knuth didn't
just enhance the existing system.

I'm told that using a blank line separates paragraphs, just as
in TeX, though I think the common macro systems make you use
an indicator like PP or LP.
