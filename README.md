# self_study
A place to do exercises from books.  I'm generally working
on more than one book at once, and as my interest waxes and wanes
I'll go at different rates.  

## In Progress

 + **random_exercises** Just random exercises in programming languages, to gain familiarity.

## Partially Complete or On Hold

 + **bird_wadler/** _Introduction to Functional Programming_, 1st ed.
 + **elem_number_theory** _Elementary Number Theory_ by Rosen.
 + **sicp/** the _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_.
 + **fp_in_scala/** _Functional Programming in Scala_.
